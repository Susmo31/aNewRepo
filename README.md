Welocome once again. Here I will show you some methods to write the readme file.

First we are using tags:---

# This is a h1 tag
## This is a h2 tag

You can bold the words using ** at the beginning and end.

You can use italics using a singe * at the beginning and end.
For example *Italics*

We can use emojis also:--
